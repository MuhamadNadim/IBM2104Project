(31/10/2020)
1. Was just starting to build a database foundation. 
2. Tomorrow (1/11/2020), learn how to upload this folder to github and how to version control.  

(1/11/2020)
1. Uploaded the whole project folder into Github. 
2. Now create a user authentication login system function for a database 
   that stores the data of managers and staffs. 
3. Created a folder dedicated to user login system.
4. Created a index page dedicated to login of the user(manager/staff).
5. Created a CSS file dedicated to the design of the index page. 

(2/11/2020)
1. Created the authentication (authenticate.php) page, home (home.php) page, logout (logout.php) page,
   and profile (profile.php) page. 

2. For a greater understanding and integration of the project's codes into the finalized codes; remove  and/or 
   redesign some codes. Redesign can be in terms of database query design, the PHP codes and 
   the appearance of the pages.     

(8/11/2020)
1. Redesign the index file to input the work email instead of username. Redesign the database that correlates with 
   it.

1. Research about how to create business functions that manages the flight schedules and its ticket sales.
2. Create a database that has a set of tables of users between the customers, the staffs, and the managers. 
   Furthermore, create another set of tables detailing airline industry related data such as flight schedules,
   ticket sales, flight crew management, aircraft maintenance, boarding status, and flight sales status.
